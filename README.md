# AutoInterviewer - AI-Powered Interview Preparation Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered interview preparation chatbot designed to help users practice and improve their interview skills. Built using Scikit-learn and OpenAI APIs, the application simulates a personalized interview experience tailored to individual career goals.

At the start of each session, users provide personal details such as their name, target job role, and skill set. Based on this information, the chatbot dynamically generates role-specific interview questions that align with the user’s chosen position.

During the interview session, the chatbot evaluates user responses in real time, assigning performance ratings and delivering constructive, actionable feedback for each answer. This enables users to identify strengths, address weaknesses, and continuously improve their interview performance.
